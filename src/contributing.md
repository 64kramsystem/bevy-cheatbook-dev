## Style Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to avoid the need for edits to your PRs and get them merged more easily:

 - Reduce verbosity. Try to get the point across with simpler code and explanations.
   - "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove."
 - Avoid repeating information found elsewhere in the book.
 - Don't forget to point out gotchas, workarounds, and other relevant practical considerations.
 - Make it easy to read:
   - Try to cover all important information without wordy explanations.
   - Prefer simple English with short sentences.
 - Use the most common/standard terminology and keywords, to make things easy to find.
   - Don't come up with new/extra terminology of your own.
 - Avoid information overload
   - Cover advanced usage separately from the basics.
   - Prefer showing related features in a single code example (when not confusing). Avoid repeated/similar examples.
 - Avoid long lines of code, to keep it readable on small screens.
