# Programming Patterns

This chapter is about any non-obvious tricks, programming techniques,
patterns and idioms, that may be useful when programming with Bevy.

These topics are an extension of the topics covered in the [Bevy Programming
Framework](../programming/_index.md) chapter. See that chapter to learn the
foundational concepts.
