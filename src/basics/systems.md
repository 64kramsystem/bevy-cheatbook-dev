# Systems

Systems are functions you write, which are run by Bevy.

This is where you implement all your game logic.

These functions can only take special parameter types, to specify what game data you want to access.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../code_bevy_release/src/basics.rs:sys-debug-res}}
```
