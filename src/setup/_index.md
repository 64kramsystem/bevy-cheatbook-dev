# Bevy Setup Tips

This chapter is a collection of additional tips for configuring
your project or development tools, collected from the Bevy
community, beyond what is covered in Bevy's [official setup
documentation](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started).

If you know of anything that would be nice to add, please file an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bevy-cheatbook/bevy-cheatbook) or ping me
on Discord (`@Ida Iyes#0981`).
