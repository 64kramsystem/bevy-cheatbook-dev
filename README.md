### Help Wanted

Specific things that I would really appreciate help with:

 - Adding new syntax to the [cheatsheet for the latest Bevy Git](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/cheatsheet/master.html).
 - More [Cookbook](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/cookbook/_index.html) examples.
 - More content for [Advanced Patterns](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/patterns/_index.html) and [Common Pitfalls](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/pitfalls/_index.html).
   - Especially if you frequent the Bevy Discord (or other communities) and know what kinds of things people come across.
